# BROKENMAST
BROKENMAST itself is based on security through obscurity for the sake of simplicity, allowing for instant file-sharing without compromising agility.

It is dynamic in nature, constantly updated through communal suggestions and contributions. There is no one BROKENMAST protocol. 

BROKENMAST needn't be a one-case-fits-all. It is purely the terminology we settled on for this format. Feel free to create your own version of BROKENMAST to use amongst friends, collectives, groups, etc.<br>
